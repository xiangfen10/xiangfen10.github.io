 <p style="text-align:center"><br></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">The welded pipe mould is placed on the supporting wheel of the adjusting mechanism, which drives the pipe mould to rotate at a uniform speed, and the continuously variable transmission mechanism makes the welding machine cart move forward with the welding wheel along the axis of the inner wall of the pipe mould t a uniform speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">The welding wires are transported by the automatic wire feeding mechanism and the inner wall welding shall be pperformed by submerged arc automatic welding. The welding pass overlapping degree is 1/3~2/3, and the internal welding length at two ends of pipe mould shall be not more than 1.2m. The enough machining allowance shall be left on the welding surface after welding, which is usually 2-4mm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Basic parameters of welding</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Preheating temperature of <a data-mid="5" href="105.html">casting pipe mould</a> before welding: 250-350</span><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:宋体">℃</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Welding current: 400A</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Welding voltage: 34V</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Wire diameter: 2-2.5mm</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Welding speed: 0.7-0.8 cm/min</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Type of welding wire: H08CrMoVA</span></p><p><br></p>
